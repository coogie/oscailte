# Oscailte &mdash; An Octopress theme

Oscailte ([IPA: [ˈɔsˠkɪlʲtʲɪ]](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Irish_pronunciation)) is a light and clean theme, built using [inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com/), for use on [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) sites. The theme can be viewed in action on [my personal site](http://coog.ie/).

## Installation

Oscailte requires that you use Sass 3.2.9 (Media Mark) or greater, so you may need to run a `bundle update` before you run your initial `rake generate` after installing the theme. You can check your current gem version by running `gem list sass` in your Octopress directory.

You can install Oscailte like so:

    $ cd your_octopress_directory
    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/coogie/oscailte.git .themes/oscailte //The --recursive option is required to pull in inuitcss
    $ rake install['oscailte']
    $ bundle update //You may or may not need this, check note above
    $ rake generate

## Features

### Homepage

Oscailte includes a clean page, separated from the blogging capabilities of Octopress. The theme can be modified to instead use just the blog index as the homepage.

### Gravatar

Oscailte makes use of the `site.email` used in `_config.yml` (if present) to grab and display your Gravatar if you use one. Otherwise, the theme will instead display the default Gravatar logo, which can be changed by replacing the file locally.

If you wish to make use of the Gravatar feature, please ensure you use an email address that you do not mind being publicly crawlable by bots/spiders.

### Social Sidebar

Oscailte allows you to display links to your other online profiles in a quick and easy fashion. To display the sidebar links to your other profiles, you must add the following to your `_config.yml` file.

~~(Oscailte does not make use of the default `github_user` and `twitter_user` keys)~~

  title: # Defaults to "Follow me!" if not present

Oscailte only supports the above sites, but more may be (infinitely) added as the user sees fit.
