Oscailte ([IPA: [ˈɔsˠkɪlʲtʲɪ]](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Irish_pronunciation) Gaeilge for "Open") is a light and clean theme, built using [inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com/), for use on [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) sites and released under the MIT Licence.

## Installation

Oscailte requires that you use Sass 3.2.9 (Media Mark) or greater, so you may need to run a `bundle update` before you run your initial `rake generate` after installing the theme. You can check your current gem version by running `gem list sass` in your Octopress directory.

Because Oscailte also uses git submodules to pull in inuitcss, when you run git clone you must add in the --recursive option in order to get it working.

You can install Oscailte like so:

    $ cd your_octopress_directory
    $ git clone --recursive -b master https://github.com/coogie/oscailte.git .themes/oscailte
    $ rake install['oscailte']
    $ rake generate

Having problems when installing with zsh? Try `rake install\['oscailte'\]` instead.

## Features

### Homepage

Oscailte includes a clean page, separated from the blogging capabilities of Octopress. The theme can be modified to instead use just the blog index as the homepage.

### Excerpts

While excerpts are not necessarily a theme feature, Oscailte contains styling to support them. In order to use excerpts on your site simply insert `<!-- more -->` somewhere inside your post content to trigger the break.

### Gravatar

Oscailte makes use of the `site.email` used in `_config.yml` (if present) to grab and display your Gravatar if you use one. Otherwise, the theme will instead display the default Gravatar logo, which can be changed by replacing the file locally.

If you wish to make use of the Gravatar feature, please ensure you use an email address that you do not mind being publicly crawlable by bots/spiders.

### Social Sidebar

Oscailte allows you to display links to your other online profiles in a quick and easy fashion. To display the sidebar links to your other profiles, you must add the following to your `_config.yml` file.
Please note that these are only required if you wish to display items such as Social Sidebar, Github Repos, Twitter Timeline, and [Facebook OpenGraph Metadata](#facebook-open-graph).

(Oscailte *does not* make use of the default `github_user` and `twitter_user` keys)

```` yml
...
social:
  title: # Defaults to "Follow me!" if not present
  adn: # App.net
  dribbble:
  facebook:
    user:
    app_id:
  github:
    user:
    show_profile_link:
  googleplus:
  linkedin:
  pinterest:
  stackoverflow:
  twitter:
    user:
    widget:
      is_shown:
      show_profile_link:
      widget_id:
  youtube:
````

Oscailte supports the above sites out of the box, but more may be (infinitely) added as the user sees fit.

The colours for these are defined in `_variables.scss` as a key-value pair, with the key being used to create the class name. If you *do* add your own in and would like to colour it accordingly, you can create an entry in your own `_variables.scss` file. You can see the SCSS at work on [L#65 of `_social.scss`](https://github.com/coogie/oscailte/blob/master/sass/oscailte/aside/_social.scss#L65)

### Facebook Open Graph ([Preview](http://i.imgur.com/iLDBoFV.png))

Oscailte supports the use of Facebook Open Graph metadata to give that little *umph* when somebody shares a link to your site on somebody's Facebook timeline/wall. To enable this, you must first add the following to your `_config.yml` file:

``` yml
...
social:
  facebook:
    app_id: xxxxxxxxxx
```

If you don't know how to get an App ID, you can pick one up by going to the [Insights Dashboard](https://www.facebook.com/insights/) and clicking the green button in the top-right that reads "Insights for your website". The App ID can be found in the modal that appears on the page. **Make sure you add the App ID to your Octopress site, compile, and push to your hosting before proceeding with the modal on Facebook.**

Some optional, yet useful options are also available to use on a per-page/post basis

``` yml
---
layout: post
title: "Example Post Title"
date: 2014-02-18 11:35:55 +0000
comments: true
categories: [category 1, category 2]

# Provide an image thumbnail for Facebook OpenGraph
facebook:
  image: http://yoursite.com/image.jpg

---
```

 - **og:title** will try to use the `post.title`, falling back to `page.title`, and then finally `site.title`
 - **og:site_name** uses the value of `site.title`
 - **og:url** will use the canonical link for the page, falling back to `site.url`
 - **og:description** will attempt to use the `description` from the post/page's own YML file, falling back to use `content | raw_content` if it doesn't exist.
 - If `site.social.facebook` has been set, **og:author** will associate the post/page with that user.
 - If `facebook.image` has been set in the post/page's own YML file, **og:image** will use its value as an image for that particular page/post

Big thanks to [@zclancy](https://github.com/zclancy)'s post, "[Twitter Cards, Facebook Open Graph, and Octopress](http://blackglasses.me/2013/09/19/twitter-cards-facebook-open-graph-and-octopress/)" from which I ~~stole~~ referenced the code! ;)

### Twitter Timeline Aside ([Preview](http://i.imgur.com/ofdupZj.png))

Since the release of v1.1 of the Twitter API, Twitter removed support for unauthenticated API calls.
Twitter does, however, offer a widget that integrates well with blogging platforms - including Octopress.

To get started, head over to Twitter's [Widgets Configurator](https://twitter.com/settings/widgets/new) page and create a new Widget. Next, copy the code and look for `data-widget-id="xxxxxxxxxxxx"`.
Copy this widget ID and then update the `social` settings for Oscailte.

```yml
social:
  twitter:
    user: username
    widget:
      is_shown: true
      show_profile_link: true
      widget_id: xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Next, modify your `default_asides` within your `_config.yml` to include the Twitter Aside and you're good to go!

```
default_asides: [asides/recent_posts.html, asides/github.html, asides/twitter.html]
```

## Customising Oscailte

### Site Colours

Many of the colours used throughout Oscailte can be fully customised and found within [`_variables.scss`](https://github.com/coogie/oscailte/blob/master/sass/oscailte/_variables.scss).

### Default Dummy Text

You can modify the default 'Lorem Ipsum' text on the homepage by editing the following files located in `source\_includes\custom`:
* welcome.html
* grid_item_left.html
* grid_item_middle.html
* grid_item_right.html

### Default Icons on Homepage
You can modify and change the default icons which are above the grid items by editing the following file in the `source` directory:
* index.html

You can edit the following class names with your [preferred ones](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/3.2.1/icons/) to change the left, middle, and right icons respectively.
``` html
<i class="icon-laptop"></i>
<i class="icon-search"></i>
<i class="icon-coffee"></i>
```

### Using the Blog as the Homepage

By default, Oscailte comes with a homepage separate from the blogging capabilities. If you wish to use the Blog index as your default Hompage, you can run the following command from your root directory:

    $ cp source/blog/index.html source/index.html

This will overwrite the default index with the contents of the Blog index. **Be sure to update your [`source/_includes/custom/navigation.html`](https://github.com/coogie/oscailte/blob/master/source/_includes/custom/navigation.html) file.**


### Modifying the Image and Related Text on Homepage
#### Modifying image
By default, Oscailte uses `cliffs_of_moher.jpg` in the `source/images` directory. If you wish to change it, you can add your own image to the `source/images` directory and then edit the following file
* source/_includes/site/hero_unit.html

and replace `cliffs_of_moher.jpg` with your own image.

#### Modifying text
For modifying the text, you can replace the following with your preferred text, or remove it entirely:

``` html
Cliffs of Moher, by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alfarese/2780612581/" target="_blank">Alessandro Farese</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/deed.en" target="_blank" class="licence"><small>(by-nc-nd)</small></a>

```
