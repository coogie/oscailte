# Getting Started

Getting started with Oscailte is straightforward. Oscailte aims to work out-of-the-box
with Jekyll and Github Pages, meaning it requires no manual plugin installation and
doesn't require you to manually build your site before uploading it - just upload the raw
Jekyll source and let Github Pages do the rest.

Of course, you can always extend it with your own plugins and build steps as necessary.
